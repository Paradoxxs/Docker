    { "summary": "Known Issues <ul><li>It is still possible to update your grid from any release candidate to 2.3. However, if you have a true production deployment, then we recommend a fresh image and install for best results.</li><li>In 2.3.0 we made some changes to data types in the elastic index templates. This will cause some errors in Kibana around field conflicts. You can address this in 2 ways:<ol><li>Delete all the data on the ES nodes preserving all of your other settings suchs as BPFs by running sudo so-elastic-clear on all the search nodes</li><li>Re-Index the data. This is not a quick process but you can find more information at <a href='https://docs.securityonion.net/en/2.3/elasticsearch.html#re-indexing' target='so-help'>https://docs.securityonion.net/en/2.3/elasticsearch.html#re-indexing</a></li></ol><li>Please be patient as we update our documentation. We have made a concerted effort to update as much as possible but some things still may be incorrect or ommited. If you have questions or feedback, please start a discussion at <a href='https://securityonion.net/discuss' target='so-discuss'>https://securityonion.net/discuss</a>.</li><li>Once you update your grid to 2.3.0, any new nodes that join the grid must be 2.3.0. For example, if you try to join a new RC1 node it will fail. For best results, use the latest ISO (or 2.3.0 installer from github) when joining to an 2.3.0 grid.</li><li>Shipping Windows Eventlogs with Osquery will fail intermittently with utf8 errors logged in the Application log. This is scheduled to be fixed in Osquery 4.5.</li><li>When running soup to upgrade from RC1/RC2/RC3 to 2.3.0, there is a Salt error that occurs during the final highstate. This error is related to the patch_os_schedule and can be ignored as it will not occur again in subsequent highstates.</li><li>When Search Nodes are upgraded from RC1 to 2.3.0, there is a chance of a race condition where certificates are missing. This will show errors in the manager log to the remote node. To fix this run the following on the search node that is having the issue:<ol><li>Stop elasticsearch - <i>sudo so-elasticsearch-stop</i></li><li>Run the SSL state - <i>sudo salt-call state.apply ssl</i></li><li>Restart elasticsearch - <i>sudo so-elasticsearch-restart</i></li></ol></li><li>If you are upgrading from RC1 you might see errors around registry:2 missing. This error does not break the actual upgrade. To fix, run the following on the manager:</li><ol><li>Stop the Docker registry - sudo docker stop so-dockerregistry</li><li>Remove the container - sudo docker rm so-dockerregistry</li><li>Run the registry state - sudo salt-call state.apply registry</li></ol></ul>" }
